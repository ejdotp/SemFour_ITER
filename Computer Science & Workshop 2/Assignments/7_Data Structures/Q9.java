/* Create a class Graph with a linked list member to represent N number of
 * vertices. Implement the required constructor. Add a method to the Graph class
 * for reading a graph and storing it in an adjacency list representation.
 * Include a depth-first search (DFS) method in the Graph class to traverse the
 * vertices of the graph, and a main method to invoke all the methods.*/
