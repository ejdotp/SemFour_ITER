/* Construct a binary search tree (BST) from the given array of elements: {10,
 * 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}. Include a method called 'CreateTree' to
 * construct the binary search tree from a sorted array. This method takes an
 * array of integers as input and constructs the tree recursively using a binary
 * search algorithm.*/
