//Write a program to create a Car class with member variables model, color, and speed. Add the respective method and constructor to it. Create a driver class in that class and create two car objects. Compare the car objects according to their speed and print the details of the car that has a greater speed. Note: Overload compareTo method of Comparable interface.
