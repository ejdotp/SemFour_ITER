//Design a Java program for managing student enrollment in a university, adhering to the principles of loose coupling and high cohesion. Your program should include classes for representing students (`Student`), courses (`Course`), and enrollment management (`Enrollment`). Ensure that the `Enrollment` class interacts with the other classes indirectly through an interface class (`EnrollmentSystem`). Implement methods for enrolling and dropping students from courses, and displaying enrollment details. Create a `Main` class to demonstrate the system's functionality, with appropriate error handling and user-friendly output messages. Provide comments in your code explaining how loose coupling and high cohesion are maintained throughout the implementation.
